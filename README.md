# Email Spam Detection With Machine Learning 

# Business Problem: 
  The business problem is to detect and classify emails as spam or non-spam (ham). Spam emails, also known as junk mail, are a
  nuisance to users and can potentially contain harmful content such as scams or phishing attempts. Detecting spam emails accurately 
  is crucial to ensuring the safety and security of users' email accounts.

  # Business Insight: 
    By developing an email spam detector using machine learning, businesses can automatically filter out spam emails from users' 
  inboxes, thus improving the overall email experience and reducing the risk of users falling victim to scams or phishing attacks. 
  This can lead to increased user satisfaction, trust, and engagement with the email platform.
